> Keep multiple Git repositories aligned with their default branch.

`git-align` helps you update many local repositories in one go.  
It fetches, rebases, and keeps your branches in sync with the default branch (`origin/HEAD`), while handling local changes safely.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔄 Update multiple repositories at once
- ⚡ Parallel execution support
- 🎯 Interactive selection with `fzf`
- ⏱️ Filter repositories by recent remote changes (`--since`)
- 🔀 Rebase current branch on default branch
- 🧹 Auto-stash and restore local changes
- 📜 Optional detailed logs
- 🧠 Smart log cleanup (only failures kept by default)

---

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Installer

```bash
bash install.sh
```

This installs `git-align` and its companion `git-align.version` file into Homebrew's bin when writable, or `~/.local/bin` otherwise.

---

### Option 2: Manual

```bash
cp bin/git-align ~/.local/bin/git-align
cp VERSION ~/.local/bin/git-align.version
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/git-align
```

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your `$PATH`.

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
git-align [options]
```

---

## ⚙️ Options

| Option               | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `-p, --parallel <n>` | Run in parallel with `n` jobs                   |
| `-s, --since <time>` | Only update repos with recent remote changes    |
| `-i, --interactive`  | Select repositories using `fzf`                 |
| `-v, --verbose`      | Show detailed logs after execution              |
| `--logs`             | Persist logs (otherwise only failures are kept) |
| `-V, --version`      | Show version                                    |
| `-h, --help`         | Show help                                       |

## 🔥 Examples

### Update everything

```bash
git-align
```

---

### Parallel execution

```bash
git-align -p 4
```

---

### Only recent changes

```bash
git-align -s "2 days ago"
```

---

### Interactive selection

```bash
git-align -i
```

---

### Power combo

```bash
git-align -p 4 -s "1 week ago" -i
```

---

### Debug mode

```bash
git-align -v --logs
```

---

## 🧠 How it works

For each repository:

1. Fetches all remotes
2. Detects default branch (`origin/HEAD`)
3. Checks if updates are needed
4. Stashes local changes if necessary
5. Updates default branch
6. Rebases current branch on top of it
7. Restores stash

---

## 📜 Logs

* By default:

  * Only logs of failed repositories are kept
* With `--logs`:

  * All logs are persisted under:

```bash
~/.git-align/logs/<timestamp>
```

---

## 🧪 Development

Run the current shell test suite with:

```bash
bash tests/run.sh
```

This covers CLI argument handling and syntax validation. Add new tests under `tests/` as standalone Bash scripts.

The suite now includes an integration test that creates temporary Git repositories and verifies branch update/rebase behavior end to end.

---

## 🚢 Releases

Releases are managed manually through the GitHub Actions `Release` workflow. Conventional commits still drive the next semantic version, but a release is only created when you trigger the workflow. `semantic-release` updates the Git tag, `CHANGELOG.md`, and the tracked `VERSION` file. The CLI reads its version from `git-align.version` for installed copies, then `VERSION`, then the latest Git tag.

To cut a release:

```text
GitHub -> Actions -> Release -> Run workflow
```

Use the optional `dry_run` input to preview the next version and notes without creating a tag or release.

---

## ⚠️ Requirements

* `git`
* [`fd`](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd)
* [`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) (optional, for interactive mode)

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install fd fzf
```

---

## ⚡ Performance

* Uses `fd` for fast repository discovery
* Supports parallel execution via `xargs -P`
* Optimized for large monorepo-style directory structures
